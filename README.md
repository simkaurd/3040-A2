## FAQs
1. Why is my resume not showing on the static website?
* Please ensure all of these conditions are met for seemless rendering of your static website.
  * You *must* have your resume saved as "index.md" as GitHub pages picks up file named "index" as their base for the website and renders it into HTML.
  * You *must* have your "index.md" file in the root directory of your repository.
  * You *must* have your GitHub Pages configured properly - i.e. to build from root directory in the main branch.
  * You *must* ensure GitHub has finished building all changes. This will ensure you see the latest changes on your static website. GIFFFFF
    
2. Why is markdown better than a word processor?
*  Markdown is a plain text file with limited syntax and features. While word processors offer high utility, Markdown offers simplicity and versatility which makes it an ideal choice for technical writing. Additionally, GitHub Pages features easy rendering of Markdown to HTML which allows us to create static websites without the need for advanced web development skills.
