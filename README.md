## FAQs
1. Why is my resume not showing on the static website?
* You *must* have your resume saved as "index.md" allowing Git Pages to display it on the static website.
2. Why is markdown better than a word processor?
*  Markdown is a plain text file with limited syntax and features. While word processors offer high utility, Markdown offers simplicity and versatility which makes it an ideal choice for technical writing.
